I am a second year PhD student in Computer Engineering and a part of [IDEAS Lab](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, advised by [Dr. Qi Zhu](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/). <br>

I enjoy working on real world human-centric applications using methods inspired from computer science and health research. I am interested in investigating techniques to use data-driven methods with non-manicured datasets under practical challenges (lack of data and labels, data quality, multi-modal learning and sensor fusion, issue of missing modality etc.).

Another aspect I wish to drive through my research is inclusivity in technology. I am interested in solving problems faced by the minority users ([atypical speakers and voice assisted technology](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3539490.3539601), [darker skin-tone subjects and optical heart rate monitors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7969842)). I want to emphasize on model explainability in addition to model accuracy as a key performance index in my research. <br>

Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked as an IC design engineer with [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/), where I developed metric driven and formal verification methods for application specific ICs aimed at industrial and consumer electronics. I have a Masters by Research in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during which I designed [sensing and algorithms framework for cardiac wearables](https://prezi.com/p/6t5mfk8bzu04/ms-seminar-1/).<br>
