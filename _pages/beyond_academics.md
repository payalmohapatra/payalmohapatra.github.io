# Books
I love living vicariously through books. Here is my [digital bookshelf](https://www.notion.so/payal-mohapatra/b36987dff60140929e6732607ffcb828?v=6b485368f59e40598e19ee3c4c07d3b9&pvs=4) in the recent years. (Although, I romanticise reading in a cozy coffee shop with a huge cuppa joe, in reality I am mostly consuming pages/listening to audiobooks on my commute or while waiting for my rice to get done.)

# Food
In one of my past lives, I was an ardent food blogger but now as a grad student I resort to less documentation and more nourishment. Here is make-shift [recipe book](https://www.notion.so/payal-mohapatra/4a9f711a135c4380b869ebf733d3b45b?v=0393ba157cf84538a121384a9af8fda1&pvs=4) which hopefully some day I will clean up! (If you look closely you can locate some regional dishes from my native state in India - Odisha, passed down by my mother.)

# Outdoor Runs
I love running outdoors and over the years I have increased my race distances.
* TCS 5k Majja Run, Bangalore, India, 2019 - 5km
* TCS 10k, Bangalore, India, 2020 - 10km
* Hot Chocolate Race, Chicago, USA, 2022 - 15km
* Chicago Half Marathon, Chicago, USA, 2023 - 21km

I was introduced to running by my (amazing) [partner](https://pandeyakash23.github.io/akashapandey.github.io//) and the beautiful backdrop of IIT Madras was a positive catalyst. From then on I have been blessed with gorgeous running courses or may be you enjoy the ambiance a bit more when in motion ;)
