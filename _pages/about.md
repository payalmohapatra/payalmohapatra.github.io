I am a third year PhD candidate in Computer Engineering and a part of [IDEAS Lab](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, advised by [Dr. Qi Zhu](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/). <br>

I enjoy working on real world human-centric applications using methods inspired from computer science and health research. I investigate machine-learning methods for real-world applications with a focus on audio, healthcare and generally time series sensor data. These applications are ubiquitous and pose unique challenges in data analyses and learning. My focus is to develop robust learning algorithms for data (quality, quantity, and labels) and resource constrained applicationa. I am currently interested in exploring design trade-offs based on personalization and generalization of an algorithm for a system.

Another aspect I wish to drive through my research is inclusivity in technology. I am interested in solving problems faced by the minority users ([atypical speakers and voice assisted technology](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3539490.3539601), [darker skin-tone subjects and optical heart rate monitors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7969842)). I want to emphasize on model explainability in addition to model accuracy as a key performance index in my research. <br>

Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked as an IC design engineer with [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/), where I developed metric driven and formal verification methods for application specific ICs aimed at industrial and consumer electronics. I have a Masters by Research in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during which I designed [sensing and algorithms framework for cardiac wearables](https://prezi.com/p/6t5mfk8bzu04/ms-seminar-1/).<br>
