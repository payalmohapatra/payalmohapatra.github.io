I am a first year PhD student in Computer Engineering and a part of [IDEAS Lab](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, advised by [Dr. Qi Zhu](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/). <br>
Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked as an IC design engineer with [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/), where I developed metric driven and formal verification methods for application specific ICs aimed at industrial and consumer electronics. I have a Masters by Research in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during which I designed [sensing and algorithms framework for cardiac wearables](https://prezi.com/p/6t5mfk8bzu04/ms-seminar-1/).<br>
I enjoy working on real world human-centric applications using methods inspired from computer science and health research. One of the fundamental assumptions of most learning methods is the availability of large amounts of labelled data. This may not always hold true especially. I am currently interested in solving problems of learning under data-constrained environments. Another aspect I wish to drive through my research is inclusivity in technology. I am interested in solving problems faced by the minority users ([atypical speakers and voice assisted technology](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3539490.3539601), [darker skin-tone subjects and optical heart rate monitors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7969842)). I am also exploring the area of handling fairness in learning algorithms without much overhead. <br>
