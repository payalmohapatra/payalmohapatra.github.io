I am a first year PhD student in Computer Engineering and a part of [IDEAS Lab](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, advised by [Dr. Qi Zhu](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/). <br>
Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked as an IC design engineer with [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/), where I developed metric driven and formal verification methods for application specific ICs aimed at industrial and consumer electronics. I have a Masters by Research in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during which I designed [sensing and algorithms framework for cardiac wearables](https://prezi.com/p/6t5mfk8bzu04/ms-seminar-1/).<br>
I enjoy working on real world human-centric applications using methods inspired from computer science and health research. I am currently interested in solving problems of learning under resource-constrained environments. <br>
